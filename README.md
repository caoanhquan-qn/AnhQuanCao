- [Roll Dice Game](https://caoanhquan-qn.github.io/roll-dice-game/)

#### About this project

It is a game about rolling a dice between 2 players (we call them as player 1 and player 2). The winner is who his score will reach 100 points first.

#### Game rule

- We have 2 players (player 1 and player 2). Player 1 will start first.
- Each player in his turn can roll the dice as many times as he wants. The point will be accumulated after every roll.
  **BUT** if the player rolls a one, he will lose ALL the points in his turn and it's then the next player's turn.
- The player can stop his turn by holding. All his points in the turn will be saved and add to his total points. Then it's the next player's turn.
- Who his score reaches 100 first will be the winner.
